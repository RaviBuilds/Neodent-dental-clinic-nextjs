   Hero Slide 02 — "Where NeoDent is": the two Hyderabad locations.

   Only branch names and location detail ALREADY VERIFIED inside this
   project are used here. Nampally's "Medwin Hospital Complex" comes
   from `heroLocations` above (and is legible on the branch's own
   signboard in the supplied photograph). No street address is
   invented for Mehdipatnam, so that branch carries the city only.

   Asset -> plate mapping is deliberate rather than mechanical. Each
   branch's LARGER plate uses the higher-resolution file of its pair,
   and the smaller overlapping plane uses the lower-resolution one, so
   no photograph is ever upscaled past its native size:

     Mehdipatnam  plate = interior  (960 x 1280)
                  inset = exterior  (384 x 512, entrance/threshold)
     Nampally     plate = exterior  (2240 x 1680, street frontage)
                  inset = interior  (1668 x 2224, reception)

   That also gives the two branches different subjects at different
   scales -- street presence vs. arrival -- instead of two identical
   cards.

   Hero Slide 03 — "Recognised beyond the clinic": the credibility
   chapter. The subject of this slide is NEODENT DENTAL HOSPITALS as
   an institution, not any individual doctor.

   That constraint is enforced through the copy, not just intent: no
   doctor's name appears in any VISIBLE string below. Captions name
   the OUTLET only ("The Siasat Daily", "News18 Urdu"). Doctors who
   appear inside the genuine media artifacts are supporting evidence
   for the institution's public record — they are not the subject.

   CONTENT ACCURACY — every label below is legible in its own
   artifact and nothing else is asserted:
     - "The Siasat Daily" / "Hyderabad"  -> printed in the masthead
     - "News18 Urdu"                     -> the channel bug on air
     - "Institutional recognition"       -> descriptive of the display
   Deliberately NOT quoted, even though both are legible in
   neodent-awards-recognition.jpg: the framed "National Dental
   Excellence Award 2017 — Top Dental Clinic" plaque and the Indian
   Prosthodontic Society certificate of affiliation. "Top Dental
   Clinic" is a ranking claim, and naming a specific award invites a
   date and a citation this project cannot substantiate. The artifact
   is allowed to speak for itself instead.

   ASSETS DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED:
     - dr-miftah-award-recognition.jpg — would make an individual
       doctor the focal point of an institutional slide. Dr. Miftah is
       introduced properly in his own Doctor section.
     - Dr-siraj-addressing-gathering-at-govt-dental-collage-hyderabad.jpg
       — carries burned-in subtitle text in a non-brand typeface across
       the lower third. Cropping it out removes the only thing that
       identifies the event; leaving it in breaks the type system.
     - neodent-mark.png, both doctor portraits, the treatment video —
       already carried by Slides 01/02 and the Doctor section.
   NOTE: neodent-media-siasat-02.jpg does not exist in this project.
